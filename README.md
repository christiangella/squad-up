## **Features**
The deployed application and repository contains the following features:

### **Front-End**
- Semantic HTML structuring for accessibility.
- Guided comments along JavaScript files to navigate structure.
- Thirty-Party CSS Frameworks including Bootstrap
- Defined objects with functions to obtain data
- Makes use of node package modules such as Inquirer to prompt for data
- Tests to ensure data passed in meets criterion

## **Roadmap**

The application could be improved by integrating the following:

- **Parsing through data**: The data collected and passed into the HTML file will return a comma when multiple objects are passed in.
